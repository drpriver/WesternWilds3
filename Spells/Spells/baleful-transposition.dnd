      Two target creatures, of which you can be one, instantly swap positions. Both subjects must be within range. Either or both can save against this effect. If either makes the save, the spell is foiled.

      Objects carried by the creatures (up to the creaturesâ€™ maximum loads) go with them, but other creatures do not, even if they are carried.
