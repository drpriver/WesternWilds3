Factions::section
  TODO

  Players can join factions and form factions.

  Factions give you special benefits (both realistic and like bonus feats and shit)

  Players can be in as many factions as they want, but if a faction is defeated or they come into conflict they lose
  all the bonuses.

  Some factions might not like you being in more than one faction.
