      Players can join factions.

      Factions give you special benefits (both realistic and like bonus feats and shit)

      Players can be in as many factions as they want, but if a faction is defeated or they come
      into conflict with the faction they lose all the bonuses.

      Some factions might not like you being in more than one faction.
