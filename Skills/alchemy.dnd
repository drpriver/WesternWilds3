      Brewing and crafting must take place in a well-stocked alchemical lab (which costs 1000gp to
      establish). Crafting assumes access to a market for materials - if your lab is in a secret base, you
      will need to obtain raw materials such as saltpetre explicitly somehow.

    Brew Potion::section
      ::text
        During downtime, you can brew potions. Brewing a potion takes XXX units of time and some amount of
        gold or unique material.

        All alchemists know how to brew potions of healing. To brew other potions, they need to learn the
        formula for it. Formulas can be learned from other alchemists, found written down or
        reverse-engineered from potions. However, some potions require materials so rare that they are
        essentially uncraftable from raw materials. Those are not listed here.

        Consult the table below.
