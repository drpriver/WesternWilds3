    ::text
      Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area.

      The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object.

      The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell.

      Items in a creatureâ€™s possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not.

      This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks.
