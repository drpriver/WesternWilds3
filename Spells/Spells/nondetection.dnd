      The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells.

      Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls.

      If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a will save.

      If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creatureâ€™s gear as well as the creature itself.
