    Craft Weapon::section
      ::text
        A character with at least 1 rank in craft weapon can craft any normal weapon.

        They will need a workshop to craft.

        To do so, he must purchase or acquire one half the cost of the weapon in raw materials and spend an
        amount of time crafting the weapon according to the below formula. This activity can only be done
        during downtime. 
        After that length of time, an ordinary weapon is produced.

      Crafting Formula::text
        The amount of time to craft an weapon is as follows:

        (Half the cost of the weapon in gp) / (25gp) / (craft bonus).

        The minimum amount of time is 1 day.

    Craft Masterwork Weapon::section
      ::text
        A character with at least 5 ranks in craft weapon can craft superior versions of normal weapons. One property can be added to a weapon when crafting it. The procedure is the same as the one listed above, but the character must expend an extra 2000gp in raw materials.
      Masterwork Weapon Properties::table
        ::head
          Property | Effect
        ::row
          Lightweight | Encumbers one fewer slot than normal
          Accurate    | +1 to attack
          Deadly      | damage die is one larger (eg, d6â†’d8. d12 and multi-die weapons instead are +1 damage).
          Balanced    | +4 bonus to resist disarm attempts
          Throwable   | Weapon can be thrown with a 30' range increment.
          Nimble      | Weapon can be drawn/stowed as a free action.
    Craft Grandmasterwork Weapon::section
      ::text
        A character with at least 10 ranks in craft weapon can craft grandmasterwork weapons.
        This follows the same procedure as crafting a masterwork weapon, but requires an extra 6000gp on top of that and allows two properties to be added. The properties must be different.
    Repair Weapon::text
      Repairing non-magical weapons is like crafting the weapon, but costs half as much time and money.

      Repairing magical weapons requires at least 6 ranks in craft weapon (or more, depending on the weapon) and special materials as determined by the DM.
