      You fire a barrage of magic missiles. You fire one missile per two levels. All missiles target 1 creature, striking him for 1d4+1 damage each. Then, one missile disappears and the other missiles move to strike a different creature of your choice. This process repeats until there are no more missiles.

      For example, a 6th level sorcerer casts this spell. He sends 3 missiles at an orc, then 2 at a goblin and then 1 at a kobold.

      The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature canâ€™t be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.
