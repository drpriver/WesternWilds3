                Whenever you attempt an action that has some chance of failure, you roll a twenty-sided die (d20). To determine if your character succeeds at a task you do this:
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <ul>
                <li> Roll a d20.</li>
                <li> Add any relevant modifiers.</li>
                <li> Compare the result to a target number.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <p>
                If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your character succeeds. If the result is lower than the target number, you fail.
              </p>
            </div>
            <section>
              <h4 id="dice">Dice</h4>
              <div>
                
                <p>
                  Dice rolls are described with expressions such as “3d4+3,” which means “roll three four-sided dice and add 3” (resulting in a number between 6 and 15). The first number tells you how many dice to roll (adding the results together). The number immediately after the “d” tells you the type of die to use. Any number after that indicates a quantity that is added or subtracted from the result.
                </p>
              </div>
              <section>
                <h5 id="d">d%</h5>
                <div>
                  
                  <p>
                    Percentile dice work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll) is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.
                  </p>

              <div>
                
                <p>
                  A modifier is any bonus or penalty applying to a die roll. A positive modifier is a bonus, and a negative modifier is a penalty.
                </p>

                <div>
                  
                  <p>
                    In most cases, modifiers to a given check or roll stack (combine for a cumulative effect) if they come from different sources and have different types (or no type at all), but do not stack if they have the same type or come from the same source (such as the same spell cast twice in succession). If the modifiers to a particular roll do not stack, only the best bonus and worst penalty applies. Dodge bonuses and circumstance bonuses however, do stack with one another unless otherwise specified.

                      The bonus or penalty associated with a particular ability score. Ability modifiers apply to die rolls for character actions involving the corresponding abilities.

                      An alchemical bonus is granted by the use of a nonmagical, alchemical substance such as antitoxin.

                    <p>
                      An armor bonus applies to <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> and is granted by armor or by a spell or magical effect that mimics armor. Armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> (even with natural armor bonuses) except other armor bonuses. An armor bonus doesn't apply against <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attacks</a>, except for armor bonuses granted by <a href="#force-effects">force effects</a> (such as the <a href="#mage-armor">mage armor</a> spell) which apply against <a href="#incorporeal">incorporeal</a> touch attacks, such as that of a shadow.

                      A circumstance bonus (or penalty) arises from specific conditional factors impacting the success of the task at hand. Circumstance bonuses stack with all other bonuses, including other circumstance bonuses, unless they arise from essentially the same source.

                      A competence bonus (or penalty) affects a character's performance of a particular task, as in the case of the bardic ability to <a href="#inspire-competence">inspire competence</a>. Such a bonus may apply on <a href="#attack-rolls">attack rolls</a>, <a href="#saving-throws">saving throws</a>, <a href="#skill-checks">skill checks</a>, <a href="#caster-level-checks">caster level checks</a>, or any other checks to which a bonus relating to <a href="#level">level</a> or <a href="#skill-ranks">skill ranks</a> would normally apply. It does not apply on <a href="#ability-checks">ability checks</a>, <a href="#damage-rolls">damage rolls</a>, <a href="#initiative-checks">initiative checks</a>, or other rolls that aren't related to a character's level or skill ranks. Multiple competence bonuses don't stack; only the highest bonus applies.

                      A deflection bonus affects <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> and is granted by a spell or magic effect that makes attacks veer off harmlessly.

                      A dodge bonus improves <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> (and sometimes <a href="#reflex-saves">Reflex saves</a>) resulting from physical skill at avoiding blows and other ill effects. Dodge bonuses are never granted by spells or magic items. Any situation or effect (except wearing armor) that negates a character's <a href="#dexterity-dex">Dexterity</a> bonus also negates any dodge bonuses the character may have. Dodge bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC, even other dodge bonuses. Dodge bonuses apply against <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attacks</a>.

                      An enhancement bonus represents an increase in the sturdiness and/or effectiveness of armor or natural armor, or the effectiveness of a weapon, or a general bonus to an ability score. Multiple enhancement bonuses on the same object (in the case of armor and weapons), creature (in the case of natural armor), or ability score do not stack. Only the highest enhancement bonus applies. Since enhancement bonuses to armor or natural armor effectively increase the armor or natural armor's bonus to <a href="#ac">AC</a>, they don't apply against touch attacks.

                  <p>
                    Sometimes a rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll. As long as you’re applying a single multiplier, multiply the number normally. When two or more multipliers apply to any abstract value (such as a modifier or a die roll), however, combine them into a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. Thus, a double (×2) and a double (×2) applied to the same number results in a triple (×3, because 2 + 1 = 3).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When applying multipliers to real-world values (such as weight or distance), normal rules of math apply instead. A creature whose size doubles (thus multiplying its weight by 8) and then is turned to stone (which would multiply its weight by a factor of roughly 3) now weighs about 24 times normal, not 10 times normal. Similarly, a blinded creature attempting to negotiate difficult terrain would count each square as 4 squares (doubling the cost twice, for a total multiplier of ×4), rather than as 3 squares (adding 100% twice).

                  Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging from -5 to +5. Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells shows the modifier for each score. It also shows bonus spells, which you’ll need to know about if your character is a spellcaster.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren’t die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty.

In addition to having a high ability score, a spellcaster must be of high enough class level to be able to cast spells of a given spell level.

Charisma is most important for <a href="#paladins">paladins</a>, <a href="#sorcerers">sorcerers</a>, and <a href="#bards">bards</a>.

                  A Small character gets a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. A Small character’s carrying capacity is three-quarters of that of a Medium character.

                  A Small character generally moves about two-thirds as fast as a Medium character.

                <li> 1 extra feat at 1st level.</li>

                <li> +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma.</li>
                <li> Medium: As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>
                <li> Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).</li>
                <li> Darkvision: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.</li>
                <li> Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn’t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.</li>
                <li> Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.</li>
                <li> Stability: A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).</li>
                <li> +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.</li>
                <li> +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.</li>
                <li> +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids.</li>
                <li> +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type. Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it’s caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too.</li>
                <li> +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items.</li>
                <li> +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.</li>
                <li> Automatic Languages: Common and Dwarven. Bonus Languages: Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Terran, and Undercommon.</li>

                <li> Elf base land speed is 30 feet.</li>
                <li> Immunity to magic sleep effects, and a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects.</li>
                <li> Low-Light Vision: An elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>
                <li> Weapon Proficiency: Elves receive the Martial Weapon Proficiency feats for the longsword, rapier, longbow (including composite longbow), and shortbow (including composite shortbow) as bonus feats.</li>
                <li> +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.</li>
                <li> Automatic Languages: Common and Elven. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan.</li>

                <li> Gnome base land speed is 20 feet.</li>
                <li> Low-Light Vision: A gnome can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.</li>
                <li> Weapon Familiarity: Gnomes may treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons rather than exotic weapons.</li>
                <li> +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.</li>
                <li> Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells cast by gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those from similar effects.</li>
                <li> +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids.</li>
                <li> +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type. Any time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it’s caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too.</li>

In addition, a gnome can speak with a burrowing mammal (a badger, fox, rabbit, or the like, see below). This ability is innate to gnomes. See the speak with animals spell description.</li>
                <li> Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—speak with animals (burrowing mammal only, duration 1 minute). A gnome with a Charisma score of at least 10 also has the following spell-like abilities: 1/day—dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation. Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome’s Cha modifier + spell level.</li>
