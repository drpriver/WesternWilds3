      The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. 

      The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spellâ€™s range.
