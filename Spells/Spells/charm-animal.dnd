      This spell applies to all natural animals.

      This charm makes an animal regard you as its trusted friend and ally. Essentially, the creature will join your party.

      If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.

      The spell does not enable you to control the charmed animal as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way.

      You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldnâ€™t ordinarily do.

      An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

      Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed animal breaks the spell.

      When the spell ends, the creature must save again or the spell is permanent. It still ends if you or your apparent allies attack or threaten the charmed subject. A permanent charm animal can be dispelled as any other spell can be. A creature who succeeds on this save may pretend to still be under the sway of it to get its revenge on you. Thus this second save is rolled in secret.

      A caster can only charm up to 1 creature per level of experience.

      A creature who resists this spell can never come under your charm.
