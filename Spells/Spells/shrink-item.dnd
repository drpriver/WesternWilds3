    ::text
      You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). 

      This change effectively reduces the objectâ€™s size by four categories. 

      Objects changed by a shrink item spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. 

      Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. 

      Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.
