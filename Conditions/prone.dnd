  Prone::section.text
    ::text
      The character is on the ground. 

      A creature who is prone has a -4 penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a pistol, which is at -4). A creature who is prone also grants melee attackers a +4 bonus against him.

      Ranged attackers suffer no penalty against the prone creature, but being prone often means you are behind cover which can grant +4 or greater AC.
