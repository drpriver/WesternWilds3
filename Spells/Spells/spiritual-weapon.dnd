      A weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, +1 point per three caster levels.

      The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you. 

      It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. 

      It uses your base attack bonus plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. 

      Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous roundâ€™s target. 

      On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. 

      A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks.
