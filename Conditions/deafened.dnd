      A deafened character cannot hear. 

      She takes a -4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails Listen checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells.

      Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
