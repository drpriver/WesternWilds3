    Leadership::section.feat
      Prerequisite::text
        Level 6
      Effect::section
        ::text
          You are someone others want to follow. This leadership ability and experience that
          you have acquired allows you to found or take over one of the following:
        ::bullets
          * A new domain
          * A new town
          * A class guild
        ::text
          A character can only control/manage one of these. He can turn over the institution
          to an NPC if he desires, which frees him to pick up a different one.

          Additionally, you can recruit a loyal cohort. The cohort is an NPC two levels lower
          than you. The DM will roll up 3 npcs (or choose from pre-established NPCs), and you
          can pick one. You can request a broad category of character: Warrior, Rogue,
          Priest, Mage.

          After recruitment, the cohort earns experience at half the rate you do if he does
          not accompany you on adventures. If he does accompany you on adventures, he gets a
          half-share of the treasure and earns a proportionate amount of XP (which is
          effectively half as much as you).

          The loyal cohort will not betray you unless mind controlled or cursed or whatever.

          You control the cohort during combat and adventures. The DM will roleplay the cohort
          if necessary (or you can do it, whatever).

    Kraken Blessed::section.feat
      Special::text
        Can only be taken at level 1.
      Effect::text
        One of your arms is an octopus style tentacle. You can pick up objects as normal, but cannot wield a weapon, wand, shield, etc. in this arm.

        You can use this arm to make a slam attack that deals 1d6+str Damage, and can make a free slam attack when you take a standard or full round attack action. If you make the free attack, all your attacks are at -2 for the turn.

        You get a +2 on grapple checks, and when you have a creature grappled with your tentacle, you do not count as being in the grapple (thus you can act normally).

        Additionally, the Kraken Cult holds you in high regard.
