      The warded creature gains resistance to ranged weapons. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic against ranged weapons. 

      Any ranged attack that you reduce to 0 damage instead flies back to the attacker, using the same attack roll.

      Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged.
