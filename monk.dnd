  Weapon and Armor Proficiency::text
    Monks are proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling.
    These are referred to as monk weapons.

    Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields

    When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities. He may wear normal clothing or robes.

  AC Bonus::text
    When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC. In addition, the monk gains a bonus to AC as given in his table.

  Flurry of Blows::text
    When making an unarmed attack or attack with a melee monk weapon, the monk may make an extra attack with the same weapon.

  Greater Flurry of Blows::text
    At 8th level, a monk gets another extra attack from flurry of blows.

  Unarmed Strike::text
    Monks are considered armed even when unarmed, sufferring none of the usual drawbacks of fighting unarmed. A monk's unarmed attacks can deal either lethal or nonlethal damage with every hit.

    Monks also deal increased damage. The damage is given in their monk class table.

  Fast Movement::text
    An unarmored monk gains a bonus to their land speed as given in their class table.

  Bonus Feat::text
    At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. 

    At 2nd level, the monk may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. 

    At 6th level, the monk may select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat.

    A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.

  Evasion::text
    At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, the monk instead takes no damage. 
    Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing no armor.
    A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.

  Still Mind::text
    At 3rd level, the monk gains a +2 bonus to saves against all mind-affecting effects, like charms, dominations, sleep spells, etc.

  Ki Strike::text
    At 4th level, the monk's unarmed attacks are empowered by ki. Her unarmed attacks gain a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage and are considered magical.

  Slow Fall::text
    At 4th level, a monk that falls takes damage as if they fell a shorter distance than they did. The amount of reduction is given in the class table.

  Purity of Body::text
    At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases.

  Wholeness of body::text
    At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal his own wounds. 
    He can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice his current monk level each day, and he can spread this healing out among several uses. 
    This is a swift action.
