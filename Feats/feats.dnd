Feats::section
  Acquiring Feats::text
    A character chooses a feat at 1st level and at every level divisible by 3. Some classes and races grant additional feats outside of this schedule.
  Prerequisites::text
    Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.

    A character canâ€™t use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.
