      The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet. 

      It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. 

      Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack normally. 
      Spellcasting is impossible.

      The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears.

      Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, he immediately plummets to the ground.
