                <p>
                  Dice rolls are described with expressions such as “3d4+3,” which means “roll three
                  four-sided dice and add 3” (resulting in a number between 6 and 15). The first number
                  tells you how many dice to roll (adding the results together). The number immediately
                  after the “d” tells you the type of die to use. Any number after that indicates a
                  quantity that is added or subtracted from the result.
                </p>

                <h5 id="d">d%</h5>
                <p>
                  Percentile dice work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100
                  by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll) is the
                  tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.

                <p>
                  A modifier is any bonus or penalty applying to a die roll. A positive modifier is
                  a bonus, and a negative modifier is a penalty.

                <p>
                  In most cases, modifiers to a given check or roll stack (combine for a cumulative
                  effect) if they come from different sources and have different types (or no type
                  at all), but do not stack if they have the same type or come from the same source
                  (such as the same spell cast twice in succession). If the modifiers to a particular
                  roll do not stack, only the best bonus and worst penalty applies. Dodge bonuses and
                  circumstance bonuses however, do stack with one another unless otherwise specified.

                  <p>
                    An armor bonus applies to <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> and is granted by armor or by a spell or
                    magical effect that mimics armor. Armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to
                    <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> (even with natural armor bonuses) except other armor bonuses. An
                    armor bonus doesn't apply against <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attacks</a>, except for armor bonuses
                    granted by <a href="#force-effects">force effects</a> (such as the <a href="#mage-armor">mage armor</a> spell) which apply against

                    A circumstance bonus (or penalty) arises from specific conditional factors
                    impacting the success of the task at hand. Circumstance bonuses stack with all
                    other bonuses, including other circumstance bonuses, unless they arise from
                    essentially the same source.

                  <p>
                    A competence bonus (or penalty) affects a character's performance of a particular

                    or any other checks to which a bonus relating to <a href="#level">level</a> or <a href="#skill-ranks">skill ranks</a> would
                    normally apply. It does not apply on <a href="#ability-checks">ability checks</a>, <a href="#damage-rolls">damage rolls</a>,

                    A deflection bonus affects <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> and is granted by a spell or magic effect
                    that makes attacks veer off harmlessly. Deflection bonuses stack with all other
                    bonuses to AC except other deflection bonuses. A deflection bonus applies against
                    <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attacks</a>.

                    A dodge bonus improves <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> (and sometimes <a href="#reflex-saves">Reflex saves</a>) resulting from
                    physical skill at avoiding blows and other ill effects. Dodge bonuses are never
                    granted by spells or magic items. Any situation or effect (except wearing armor)
                    that negates a character's <a href="#dexterity-dex">Dexterity</a> bonus also negates any dodge bonuses the
                    character may have. Dodge bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC, even other

                  <p>
                    An enhancement bonus represents an increase in the sturdiness and/or effectiveness
                    of armor or natural armor, or the effectiveness of a weapon, or a general bonus to
                    an ability score. Multiple enhancement bonuses on the same object (in the case of
                    armor and weapons), creature (in the case of natural armor), or ability score do
                    not stack. Only the highest enhancement bonus applies. Since enhancement bonuses
                    to armor or natural armor effectively increase the armor or natural armor's bonus
                    to <a href="#ac">AC</a>, they don't apply against touch attacks.

                  <p>
                    An insight bonus improves performance of a given activity by granting the character
                    an almost precognitive knowledge of what might occur. Multiple insight bonuses on
                    the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest insight bonus applies.

                    A luck modifier represents good (or bad) fortune. Multiple luck bonuses on the same

                    (or hopelessness, cowardice, and despair in the case of a morale penalty). Multiple
                    morale bonuses on the same character do not stack. Only the highest morale bonus
                    applies. Nonintelligent creatures (creatures with an <a href="#intelligence-int">Intelligence</a> of 0 or no
                    Intelligence at all) cannot benefit from morale bonuses.

                    A natural armor bonus improves <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> resulting from a creature's naturally
                    tough hide. Natural armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to Armor Class
                    (even with armor bonuses) except other natural armor bonuses. Some magical effects
                    (such as the <a href="#barkskin">barkskin</a> spell) grant an enhancement bonus to the creature's
                    existing natural armor bonus, which has the effect of increasing the natural
                    armor's overall bonus to Armor Class. A natural armor bonus doesn't apply against

                    a creature's race changes (for instance, if it dies and is reincarnated), it loses
                    all racial bonuses it had in its previous form.

                    magic effect that mimics a shield. Shield bonuses stack with all other bonuses to
                    AC except other shield bonuses. A magic shield typically grants an
                    <a href="#enhancement-bonus">enhancement bonus</a> to the shield's shield bonus, which has the effect of
                    increasing the shield's overall bonus to AC. A shield bonus granted by a spell or
                    magic item typically takes the form of an invisible, tangible field of force that
                    protects the recipient. A shield bonus doesn't apply against <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attacks</a>.

                  In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the fraction is

                <h5 id="multiplying">Multiplying</h5>
                <p>
                  Sometimes a rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll. As long as you’re
                  applying a single multiplier, multiply the number normally. When two or more
                  multipliers apply to any abstract value (such as a modifier or a die roll),
                  however, combine them into a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding
                  1 less than its value to the first multiple. Thus, a double (×2) and a double
                  (×2) applied to the same number results in a triple (×3, because 2 + 1 = 3).
                </p>
                <p>
                  When applying multipliers to real-world values (such as weight or distance),
                  normal rules of math apply instead. A creature whose size doubles (thus
                  multiplying its weight by 8) and then is turned to stone (which would multiply
                  its weight by a factor of roughly 3) now weighs about 24 times normal, not 10
                  times normal. Similarly, a blinded creature attempting to negotiate difficult
                  terrain would count each square as 4 squares (doubling the cost twice, for
                  a total multiplier of ×4), rather than as 3 squares (adding 100% twice).

              <p>
                Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging from
                -5 to +5. Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells shows the modifier for each
                score. It also shows bonus spells, which you’ll need to know about if your
                character is a spellcaster.
              </p>
              <p>
                The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries
                to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some
                numbers that aren’t die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a
                negative modifier is called a penalty.

              <p>
                The ability that governs bonus spells depends on what type of spellcaster your
                character is: Intelligence for <a href="#wizards">wizards</a>; Wisdom for <a href="#clerics">clerics</a>, <a href="#druids">druids</a>, <a href="#paladins">paladins</a>,
                and <a href="#rangers">rangers</a>; or Charisma for <a href="#sorcerers">sorcerers</a> and <a href="#bards">bards</a>. In addition to having a high
                ability score, a spellcaster must be of high enough class level to be able to cast
                spells of a given spell level.

                When an ability score changes, all attributes associated with that score change

                  <a href="#monks">monks</a> because it helps them prevail in combat. Strength also limits the amount

                    Charisma measures a character’s force of personality, persuasiveness, personal
                    magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. This ability represents
                    actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a

              <p>
                When creating a new character, ability scores can be determined either by rolling,
                using an array, or using a hybrid method

              <p>
                To roll your ability scores, roll four six-sided dice and discard the die with the
                lowest value. Total the three remaining dice. This number is your strength score.
              </p>
              <p>
                Repeat this process for the other five abilities (dexterity, constitution,
                intelligence, wisdom, charisma).

              </p>
              <p>
                For the remaining ability scores, roll 4d6, discarding the lowest die.

                Elves' brains are alien and otherworldly. They do not sleep, instead they meditate for 4 hours in state known as trancing. 4 hours of trancing a night gives the same benefits as 8 hours of sleep does a human.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to this, elves are immune to sleep effects, and  get a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects.

Additionally, they get a +4 bonus to overrun and bull rush checks and strength checks where mass would be of aid (like forcing open or holding a door).
              </p>

                Loxodons are on average 8' tall.

              <p>
                Loxodons are too large and heavy to ride horses and similar sized mounts. However, when travelling long distances they count as mounted for the purposes of determing overland travel rates.

                Loxodons have great memory, able to recall exact events or spoken words when they need to (although they may not remember they need to remember until reminded). Due to this, they have no native writing system in the loxodon language and do not generally pick up how to read other languages. Loxodons start play with no ability to read or write.  A loxodon may spend 2 skill points after the 1st level to learn to read and write the languages they speak.
              </p>
              <p>

It can be used to hold one handed items, draw items from their inventory, etc. It cannot be used to effectively wield weapons or shields. Switching an item between the trunk and a hand is a free action.

              A character's allegience in the cosmic fight between good and evil and between law and chaos is represented by their alignment:

              All characters have a character class, which is the general archetype of character they are playing.

              <p>
                A multiclass character is a character that is more than once class at once. These classes are denoted by the '/' separating the class names, for example the Fighter/Wizard or the Cleric/Wizard/Thief.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the purposes of choosing feats, the character can choose from either of the classes's feat list. For all spells, effects, requirements, etc. they count as a member of both of their classes.
              </p>
              <p>
                A multiclass character requires more experience points to level up than a non-multiclass character. This multiplier is equal to the number of classes they are multiclassing. For example, a Fighter/Wizard requires twice as many experience points to level up as a Fighter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike other games, only certain multiclass combinations are allowed and the math for these combinations are precomputed. Thus each multiclass combination is presented as its own class entry (although it makes copious reference to the normal classes).

                Unlike other characters, barbarians do not know how to read or write the languages they can speak. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points after the 1st level to learn to read and write the languages they speak.

            <div>
              <h4 id="rage">Rage</h4>
              <p>
                A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to <a href="#strenght-str">Strength</a>, a +4 bonus to <a href="#constitution-con">Constitution</a>, and a +2 morale bonus on <a href="#will-saves">Will saves</a>, but he takes a -2 penalty to <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian’s <a href="#hit-points">hit points</a> by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.)
              </p>
              <p>
                While raging, a barbarian cannot use any <a href="#charisma-cha">Charisma</a>-, <a href="#dexterity-dex">Dexterity</a>-, or <a href="#intelligence-int">Intelligence</a>-based skills (except for <a href="#balance">Balance</a>, <a href="#escape-artist">Escape Artist</a>, <a href="#intimidate">Intimidate</a>, and <a href="#ride">Ride</a>), or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function.  He can use any feat he has except <a href="#combat-expertise">Combat Expertise</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character’s (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can’t charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter. A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter.
              </p>
              <p>
                At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and at 8th level, he can use it one additional time per day. A barbarian regains use of his rages after restfully sleeping for 8 hours at night.
              </p>
              <p>
                Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his turn, not in response to someone else’s action.

              <p>
                At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

              <p>
                At 3rd level, the barbarian no longer suffers a -2 penalty to AC when charging.

              <p>
                At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked by thieves and can no longer be sneak attacked. This defense denies a thief the ability to sneak attack the barbarian flanking him and also denies him the bonus to attack by flanking.

                At 6th level, the barbarian gains SR equal to his level.

            <div>
              <h4 id="damage-reduction">Damage Reduction</h4>
              <p>
                At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from any source (including magic and energy attacks). Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0. This damage reduction stacks with all other forms of damage reduction.

            <div>
              <h4 id="bard-spells">Bard Spells</h4>
              <p>
                A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard’s Charisma modifier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given his table. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bard’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon reaching any level, a bard may choose to learn a new spell in exchange for a spell he already knows.  The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="bardic-knowledge">Bardic Knowledge</h4>
              <p>
                A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the bard may make a DC 20 bardic knowledge check for any unidentified magic item. Upon a successful roll, the item is identified.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="hide-in-shadows">Hide In Shadows</h4>
              <p>
                At 2nd level, the bard is able to blend into shadows and darkness to make himself nearly invisible. This functions similarily to the thief ability.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bard may not do this once combat has begun. Any amount of shadowy lighting is sufficient to allow the bard to attempt to hide in the shadows.
              </p>
              <p>
                While hiding in shadows, the bard gains the benefits of invisibility (he is not literally invisible, but if no one sees you, you effectively are). This ends if he draws attention to himself, attacks, casts a spell, sings a song, etc. Although he may not hide while in combat, a bard will often begin combat hidden in the shadows. The bard may move about while hiding in shadows, as long as he remains within some amount of shadow or natural obscurement.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the bard's hiding is tested, the bard rolls a hide check contested by the opposing creature's spot check. A creature must be within 20 feet of the bard to be eligible to roll a spot check.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="bardic-music">Bardic Music</h4>
              <p>
                Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn’t require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), spell trigger (such as wands), or command word. Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.

              <h4 id="countersong">Countersong</h4>
              <p>
                A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard’s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard’s Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don’t allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.

              <h4 id="fascinate">Fascinate</h4>
              <p>
                A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.
              </p>
              <p>
                To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature’s Will save against the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.

              <h4 id="inspire-courage">Inspire Courage</h4>
              <p>
                A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 4th and 8th level, this bonus increases by 1. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="inspire-competence">Inspire Competence</h4>
              <p>
                A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard’s music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can’t inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="suggestion">Suggestion</h4>
              <p>
                A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated. Using this ability does not break the bard’s concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the fascinate effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                Making a suggestion doesn’t count against a bard’s daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + ½ bard’s level + bard’s Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.

              <p>
                A cleric’s alignment must be within one step of his deity’s (that is, it may be one
                step away on either the lawful-chaotic axis or the good-evil axis, but not both).
                A cleric may not be neutral on an axis unless his deity’s alignment is also neutral
                on that axis.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, a lawful good cleric of a lawful neutral god is allowed.
                A chaotic netural cleric of a chaotic evil god is not allowed.

              <p>
                A cleric must worship a deity. A cleric does not necessarily need to be a member of
                the organized religion of that deity, but that would be unusual.
              </p>
              <p>
                A cleric chooses two domains from his deity's domains, which grant him a special
                ability and access to a bonus spell in his domain slot (see spells below).
              </p>
            </div>

              <h4 id="spells">Spells</h4>
              <p>
                A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell list. However,
                his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or
                ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must
                choose and prepare his spells in advance.
              </p>
              <p>
                To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at
                least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric’s
                spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric’s Wisdom modifier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each
                spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given in his table. In addition,
                he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one
                domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric
                prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he
                must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily
                allotment of spells. See <a href="#spell-recuperation">spell recuperation</a>. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell
                on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must
                choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.
              </p>

              <h4 id="spell-conversion">Spell Conversion</h4>
              <p>
                A cleric can spontaneously convert any of his spells into one of his domain spells. He
                loses that prepared spell and instead casts a domain spell of the corresponding level.
                This does not make the cleric a spontaneous caster.

                <p>
                  Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by
                  channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All clerics can turn undead (for evil clerics it is fear of a more powerful source
                  rather than of goodness). Powerful Good and neutral clerics destroy undead, while
                  powerful evil clerics instead command the undead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his
                  Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +1
                  bonus on turning checks against undead.

                <p>
                  Turning undead is a supernatural ability that a character can perform as a standard
                  action. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You must present your holy symbol to turn undead. Turning is considered an attack.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 id="range">Range</h5>
                <p>
                  You turn the closest turnable undead first, and you can’t turn undead that are more
                  than 60 feet away or that have total cover relative to you. You don’t need line of
                  sight to a target, but you do need line of effect.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 id="turning-check">Turning Check</h5>
                <p>
                  The first thing you do is roll a turning check to see how powerful an undead creature
                  you can turn. Roll a d6-3 and add the result to your level. This is the Hit Dice of
                  the most powerful undead you can affect.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 id="turning-damage">Turning Damage</h5>
                <p>
                  If your turning check is high enough to let you turn at least some of the undead
                  within 60 feet, roll 2d6 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier for turning
                  damage. That’s how many total Hit Dice of undead you can turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You may skip over already turned undead that are still within range, so that you do
                  not waste your turning capacity on them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means available to them. They
                  flee for 10 rounds (1 minute). If they cannot flee, they cower (giving any attack
                  rolls against them a +2 bonus). If you approach within 10 feet of them, however,
                  they overcome being turned and act normally. (You can stand within 10 feet without
                  breaking the turning effect—you just can’t approach them.) You can attack them with
                  ranged attacks (from at least 10 feet away), and others can attack them in any
                  fashion, without breaking the turning effect.

                <p>
                  If you have twice as many levels (or more) as the undead have Hit Dice, you destroy
                  any that you would normally turn.
                </p>

                <h5 id="commanding-undead">Commanding Undead</h5>
                <p>
                  Evil clerics command undead instead of destroying them. Whenever an undead creature
                  would be destroyed by an evil cleric, instead they are fall under his control.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A commanded undead creature is under the mental control of the evil cleric.
                  The cleric must take a standard action to give mental orders to a commanded undead.
                  At any one time, the cleric may command any number of undead whose total Hit Dice do
                  not exceed his level. He may voluntarily relinquish command on any commanded undead
                  creature or creatures in order to command new ones.

                A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells

              <p>
                Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, cutlass, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape.
              </p>
              <p>
                Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the ironwood spell description) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.
              </p>
              <p>
                A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

                <p>
                  A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).
                </p>
                <p>
                  To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid’s Wisdom modifier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. She does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.
                </p>

              <div>
                <h5 id="spontaneous-wild-shape">Spontaneous Wild Shape</h5>
                <p>
                  A druid can channel stored spell energy into wild shape spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast any wild shape spell of the same level or lower.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 id="chaotic-evil-good-and-lawful-spells">Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</h5>
                <p>
                  A druid can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.
                </p>

              <h4 id="bonus-languages">Bonus Languages</h4>
              <p>
                A druid’s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.
              </p>
              <p>
                A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
              </p>
              <p>
                Druidic has its own alphabet.

              <h4 id="nature-sense">Nature Sense</h4>
              <p>
                A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.
              </p>
              <p>
                A druid can spend points in the scent skill, although she can only use it when
                wildshaped into an appropriate creature.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="wild-empathy">Wild Empathy</h4>
              <p>
                A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.
              </p>
              <p>
                The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.
              </p>
              <p>
                To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
              </p>
              <p>
                A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.

              <p>
                Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="trackless-step">Trackless Step</h4>
              <p>
                Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.
              </p>

                Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

                At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature to be his favored enemy (given below).
                The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type.
                Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.
                At 5th level, the ranger may select an additional favored enemy.
                In addition, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.

                  The ranger is able to follow tracks.
                  To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed with a -5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a -20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions, as given on Table: Track DC.

              <p>
                A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.
              </p>
              <p>
                To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.

              <h4 id="favored-terrain">Favored Terrain</h4>
              <p>
                At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of terrain to be his favored terrain (given below).
                The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Hide, Move Silently, Search, Listen, Spot, and Survival skill checks while operating in his favored terrain. These benefits only apply outdoors - if you enter a dungeon the benefits no longer apply.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, when the ranger builds a shelter in the wilderness (see <a href="#survival">Survival</a>), the level of the shelter is upgraded by 1 level. The ranger can build level 3 shelters even in wilderness in hostile territories.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, when travelling long distances through his favored terrain, the ranger and a number of creatures up to (his level + 2)*2 move at twice the normal speed for that terrain if traveling off road. This speed may not exceed the speed of open terrain.
              </p>
              <p>
                At 3rd and 7th level, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain.
                In addition, the bonus against any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.

              <p>
                If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of terrain, the ranger’s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

              <h4 id="animal-companion">Animal Companion</h4>
              <p>
                A ranger may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.
              </p>
              <p>
                A 1st-level ranger’s companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a ranger advances in level, the animal’s power increases as shown on the table. If a ranger releases her companion from service, he may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.
              </p>
              <p>
                A ranger of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals. Should he select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character’s ranger level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character’s ranger level and compare the result with the ranger level entry on the table to determine the animal companion’s powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the ranger’s effective level to 0 or lower, he can’t have that animal as a companion.)
              </p>

            <div>
              <h4 id="combat-style">Combat Style</h4>
              <p>
                A ranger is selected as having the Precise Shot and Two Weapon Fighting feats, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. He loses these benefits when wearing medium or heavy armor.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="hide-in-shadows1">Hide In Shadows</h4>
              <p>
                At 3rd level, the ranger is able to blend into shadows and darkness to make himself nearly invisible. This functions similarily to the thief ability. He cannot use it while wearing medium or heavy armor.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ranger may not do this once combat has begun. Any amount of shadowy lighting is sufficient to allow the ranger to attempt to hide in the shadows. Additionally, the ranger may use the natural environment of his favored terrain to hide in the shadows. For the forest, this would be in the canopy of trees or behind bushes, for the jungle behind ferns or other vines, etc. The natural environment must provide some amount of concealment.
              </p>
              <p>
                While hiding in shadows, the ranger gains the benefits of invisibility (he is not literally invisible, but if no one sees you, you effectively are). This ends if he draws attention to himself, attacks, casts a spell, etc. Although he may not hide while in combat, a ranger will often begin combat hidden in the shadows. The ranger may move about while hiding in shadows, as long as he remains within some amount of shadow or natural obscurement.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the ranger's hiding is tested, the ranger rolls a hide check contested by the opposing creature's spot check. A creature must be within 20 feet of the ranger to be eligible to roll a spot check.

              <h4 id="bonus-ranger-feat">Bonus Ranger Feat</h4>
              <p>
                At 4th and 8th level, the ranger may select an extra ranger feat. He must still meet the prerequisites.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="improved-combat-style">Improved Combat Style</h4>
              <p>
                At 6th level, a ranger’s aptitude combat style improves.  He gains the <a href="#manyshot">Manyshot</a> and <a href="#improved-two-weapon-fighting">Improved Two Weapon Fighting</a> feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.
                He loses these benefits if he wears medium or heavy armor.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="evasion1">Evasion</h4>
              <p>
                At 8th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.

              <p>
                Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons.
                They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.
                Sorcerers cannot cast spells while wearing armor.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="spells2">Spells</h4>
              <p>
                A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must.
              </p>
              <p>
                To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer’s Charisma modifier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on the tables above. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.
              </p>
              <p>
                A sorcerer’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. The sorcerer can’t use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.
              </p>
              <p>
                At every level, a sorcer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows.
                In effect, the sorcerer "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he’ll cast.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="familiar">Familiar</h4>
              <p>
                A sorcerer can obtain a familiar any time during play (he cannot start play with one). Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that is a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The sorcerer can seek out a particular kind of familiar, or see what is most responsive to his personality.
                As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the familiar dies, the sorcerer must roll against <a href="#system-shock">System Shock</a>. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer’s experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar’s demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.
              </p>
              <p>
                A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.

                Thieves are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Thieves are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

              <p>
                Thieves have the exclusive ability to flank their opponents to gain an advantage. Flanking is described in the combat chapter, but in short it is when the thief and an ally are on opposite positions of an enemy. The thief gains a +2 attack bonus against creatures he flanks. Flanking enables sneak attack (see sneak attack).

              <h4 id="sneak-attack">Sneak Attack</h4>
              <p>
                If a thief can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                The thief’s attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC, is flat-footed, or when the thief flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two thief levels thereafter. Should the thief score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is multiplied.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.
              </p>
              <p>
                With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a thief can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.
              </p>
              <p>
                The thief must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A thief cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

                    Thieves with this skill can pluck an item from another person. This is normally an opposed check against the victim's spot check, but apply the modifiers in the table below. The thief must have some opportunity to steal from the other person, such as having a conversation with them, bumping into them, the person being distracted, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    DM judgement is required for when these circumstances apply. For example, it doesn't matter if the victim trusts the thief if he can't see him because he is hidden in shadows.

                  <p>
                    This skill is used to both find and disarm traps. The DC for both is determined by the trap itself.
                    Some traps cannot be disarmed (for example a camouflaged pit trap - disarming it would just be triggering it).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A thief who fails to disarm a trap by more than 5 sets the trap off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Searching for a trap and disarming the trap each take one half of a dungeon turn.

              <h4 id="hide-in-shadows2">Hide In Shadows</h4>
              <p>
                The thief is able to blend into shadows and darkness to make himself nearly invisible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any amount of shadowy lighting is sufficient to allow the thief to attempt to hide in the shadows.
                Unlike other classes with this feature, the thief may do this once combat has begun.  To do so they must be over 20 feet from anyone other than party members and be in an area with at least some shadowy lighting. Hiding in the shadows in combat is a standard action.
              </p>
              <p>
                While hiding in shadows, the thief gains the benefits of invisibility (he is not literally invisible, but if no one sees you, you effectively are). This ends if he draws attention to himself, attacks, casts a spell, sings a song, etc. A thief will often begin combat hidden in the shadows. The thief may move about while hiding in shadows, as long as he remains within some amount of shadow or natural obscurement.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the thief's hiding is tested, the thief rolls a hide check contested by the opposing creature's spot check. A creature must be within 20 feet of the thief to be eligible to roll a spot check.

              <h4 id="evasion2">Evasion</h4>
              <p>
                At 2nd level and higher, a thief can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the thief is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless thief does not gain the benefit of evasion.

              <h4 id="skill-focus">Skill Focus</h4>
              <p>
                At 6th level, the thief gains the skill focus feat for any skill she has.

              <h4 id="uncanny-dodge1">Uncanny Dodge</h4>
              <p>
                Starting at 4th level, a thief can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="improved-uncanny-dodge1">Improved Uncanny Dodge</h4>
              <p>
                A thief of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.  This defense denies another thief the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her.
              </p>
              <p>
                At 8th level and higher, a thief can no longer be flanked by thieves and can no longer be sneak attacked. This defense denies a thief the ability to sneak attack the thief flanking him and also denies him the bonus to attack by flanking.

              <p>
                Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield.
                Wizards cannot cast spells while wearing armor or shields.

              <p>
                A wizard casts arcane spells which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. A wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time (see below).
              </p>
              <p>
                To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard’s Intelligence modifier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like other spellcasters, a wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Wizard. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting a good night’s sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.

                <p>
                  A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic, which all wizards can prepare from memory. A wizard cannot use anyone else's spellbook to prepare her spells.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice.
                </p>

                <h5 id="arcane-magical-writings">Arcane Magical Writings</h5>
                <p>
                  To record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that describes the magical forces involved in the spell. The writer uses the same system no matter what her native language or culture. However, each character uses the system in her own way. Another person’s magical writing remains incomprehensible to even the most powerful wizard until she takes time to study and decipher it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell on a scroll), a character must make a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + the spell’s level). If the skill check fails, the character cannot attempt to read that particular spell again until they gain a rank in Spellcraft. A read magic spell automatically deciphers a magical writing without a skill check.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once a character deciphers a particular magical writing, she does not need to decipher it again. Deciphering a magical writing allows the reader to identify the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in the spell description). If the magical writing was a scroll and the reader can cast arcane spells, she can attempt to use the scroll.

                  <p>
                    Wizards can add new spells to their spellbooks through several methods.

                    <p>
                      All methods require a special check to see if the spell is compatible with the shape of the wizard's mind. This learning check is an Intelligence check, with a DC of 10 + the spell's level. A successful check means the wizard can learn the spell. A failed check means the wizard can never learn that spell (and this fact should be recorded on the character sheet).
                    </p>
                  </div>

                      This seems harsh, but it means that wizards (even in the same party) will have different spells and thus play differently (otherwise two wizards in the same party would likely share their spells and have duplicate spell knowledge). I also like the flavor of spells as alien things that are only compatible with certain brains.

                  <p>
                    Wizards perform a certain amount of spell research between adventures. Each time a character attains a new wizard level, she gains two spells of her choice to add to her spellbook. The two free spells must be of spell levels she can cast. Pick spells from the wizard spell list that the wizard could cast at this new level. Roll learning checks until the wizard has learned two new spells. Keep picking spells and rolling until the wizard learns two spells. If the list of spells at a certain level is exhausted, the DM will invent new spells.

                  <p>
                    A wizard can also add a spell to her book whenever she encounters one on a magic scroll or in another wizard’s spellbook. No matter what the spell’s source, the wizard must first decipher the magical writing (see Arcane Magical Writings, above). Next, she must spend a day studying the spell. At the end of the day, she must make a learning check (see above). If the check succeeds, the wizard understands the spell and can copy it into her spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, below). If the check fails, she can never understand the spell. The process leaves a spellbook that was copied from unharmed, but a spell successfully copied from a magic scroll disappears from the parchment. A failed learning check with a scroll also consumes it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In most cases, wizards charge a fee for the privilege of copying spells from their spellbooks. This fee is usually equal to the spell’s level × 50 gp.

                    A wizard also can research a spell independently, duplicating an existing spell or creating an entirely new one. This is a downtime activity and requires an entire season to accomplish.

                <p>
                  A wizard can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost spellbook. If she already has a particular spell prepared, she can write it directly into a new book at a cost of 100 gp per page. The process wipes the prepared spell from her mind, just as casting it would. If she does not have the spell prepared, she can copy it from a borrowed spellbook and then write it into a new book.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Duplicating an existing spellbook costs 100gp per page and 24 hours per spell.

                A fighter/wizard is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields). A fighter/wizard cannot cast any spells while wearing armor. Elven Fighter/Wizards wearing elven chain can cast spells in armor, as magic is part of the nature of elves. However, elven chain is extremely rare and can never be purchased. It must be given, found, or won. It cannot be manufactured as the ways have been lost -- only inherited.

            <p>
              Each skill point you spend on a skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. You can’t save skill points to spend later. If you buy a skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on checks with that skill) for each skill point.
            </p>
            <p>
              Characters get a +1 bonus in any skill that is a class skill for them. This counts as an extra rank for any rule or effect that cares about ranks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your maximum actual rank in a skill is your character level + 3.

            <h3 id="skill-ranks">Skill Ranks</h3>
            <p>
              A character’s number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making an untrained skill check.

            <h3 id="ability-modifier1">Ability Modifier</h3>
            <p>
              The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill’s key ability (the ability associated with the skill’s use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.

            <h3 id="using-skills">Using Skills</h3>
            <p>
              A skill check takes into account a character’s training (skill rank), natural talent (ability modifier), luck (the die roll), and circumstances (all other modifiers).
            </p>
            <p>
              To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character’s skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character’s ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill’s key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)

            <h3 id="difficulty-class">Difficulty Class</h3>
            <p>
              Difficulty Class (or DC) is the number you are treating to meet or beat with your skill check to succeed at your task. The DM sets the DC based on the inherent difficulty of the task and any circumstancial modifiers.

            <h3 id="opposed-checks">Opposed Checks</h3>
            <p>
              An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character’s check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher skill modifier wins. If these scores are the same, the status quo prevails.

            <h3 id="trying-again">Trying Again</h3>
            <p>
              In general, you can't try a skill check again if you fail until you gain another rank in that skill. Some skills additionally have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.

          <div>
            <h3 id="untrained-skill-checks">Untrained Skill Checks</h3>
            <p>
              Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The skill modifier doesn’t have a skill rank added in because the character has no ranks in the skill. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill’s key ability, are applied to the check. Generally, only a basic level of success or basic kind of task can be accomplished untrained.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.

              <p>
                Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.
                The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <ul>
                <li> Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information.</li>
                <li> Give the skill user a -2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.</li>
                <li> Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.</li>
                <li> Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <p>
                Conditions that affect your character’s ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check’s DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.

            <h3 id="time-and-skill-checks">Time And Skill Checks</h3>
            <p>
              Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action.
            </p>
            <p>
              These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.

              <p>
                A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.

            <div>
              <h4 id="taking-5">Taking 5</h4>
              <p>
                When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 5. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 5. For many routine tasks, taking 5 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 5. In most cases, taking 5 is purely a safety measure — you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the below average roll (a 5). Taking 5 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn’t help.

                The players should almost never explicitly take 20. It is a tool for the DM to figure out if the players should eventually succeed at a task that can be meaningfully retried when there is no time pressure or outside distraction. In such a circumstance, the DM will ask for the player's skill check modifier, add 20 to that number and compare it to the DC, which will tell him if the players will eventually succeed. He will then randomly determine how long it actually took to accomplish the task.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, escaping from tied ropes is an escape artist check. If the player is left alone, unguarded for hours, and his bonus is high enough, he will eventually wriggle free.

                When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may overlap.

                Often, several characters attempt some action and each succeeds or fails independently. The result of one character’s Climb check does not influence the results of other characters Climb check.

              <h4 id="aid-another">Aid Another</h4>
              <p>
                You can help another character achieve success on his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill check in a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to his or her check, as per the rule for favorable conditions. (You can’t take 5 on a skill check to aid another.) In many cases, a character’s help won’t be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once.
              </p>
              <p>
                In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can’t aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn’t achieve alone.

            <h3 id="skill-synergy">Skill Synergy</h3>
            <p>
              It’s possible for a character to have two skills that work well together. In general, having 5 or more ranks in one skill gives the character a +2 bonus on skill checks with each of its synergistic skills, as noted in the skill description. In some cases, this bonus applies only to specific uses of the skill in question, and not to all checks. Some skills provide benefits on other checks made by a character, such as those checks required to use certain class features.

                Brewing and crafting must take place in a well-stocked alchemical lab (which costs 1000gp to
                establish). Crafting assumes access to a market for materials - if your lab is in a secret base, you
                will need to obtain raw materials such as saltpetre explicitly somehow.

                  The only requirement is sufficient ranks in alchemy.

                  During downtime, you can brew potions. Brewing a potion takes XXX units of time and some amount of
                  gold or unique material.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All alchemists know how to brew potions of healing. To brew other potions, they need to learn the
                  formula for it. Formulas can be learned from other alchemists, found written down or
                  reverse-engineered from potions. However, some potions require materials so rare that they are
                  essentially uncraftable from raw materials. Those are not listed here.

                You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual value.
              </p>
              <p>
                Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item’s value.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also study an item to determine whether or not it is magical.  A DC 20 appraisal check will identify an object as magical. (no retry).
              </p>
              <p>
                Appraisal also allows one to get a better price in the marketplace or when selling to specialist.  Every skill rank in appraisal improves the selling price of jewlery, gemstone and objets d’art by 1%. The best score in the party is used.

                A bluff check is made to convince another creature that you are speaking earnestly. This is usually necessary when the DM knows your character is lying. The DC for a bluff check is the target's wisdom score. The bluff skill is not used on players for this purpose - the DM just has the character lie and the players must decide for themselves whether the character is lying or not based on their knowledge and the character's behavior.

                The DM will assign a penalty or bonus to the bluff difficulty based on how outrageous or simple the lie is.
              </p>
              <p>
                A successful buff check indicates that the target believes you are not lying -- however he might believe you are mistaken if your lie is outrageous or contradicts some knowledge they have.

              <p>
                This use of bluff is to get someone to react to something in a particular way. For example, you might pretend to be afraid of a chasing tiger in an effort to get them to react with fear. Or, you can get others to look a certain direction by claiming you see something. This difficulty for this check is the target's wisdom score.
              </p>
              <p>
                A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less).
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="feinting-in-combat">Feinting in Combat</h4>
              <p>
                You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can’t dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target’s wisdom score + base attack bonus as a standard action.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your Bluff check result succeeds, your target is effectively flat-footed against the next melee attack you make against it (granting you a +2 bonus to your attack). This attack must be made on or before your next turn.
              </p>
              <p>
                Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it’s harder to read a strange creature’s body language; you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it’s even harder; you take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it’s impossible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

              <h4 id="delivering-a-secret-message">Delivering a Secret Message</h4>
              <p>
                You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can’t get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Listen check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message.

              <p>
                You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. While climbing, you can’t move to avoid a blow, so you are effectively flat-footed. You also can’t use a shield while climbing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.

                With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.

                If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. You must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character’s fall but don’t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character’s fall and begin falling as well.

              <p>
                Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others’ Spot check results. If you don’t draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Spot checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers rolled a 10 on their Spot checks.
              </p>
              <p>
                You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people are making Spot checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can’t be sure how good the result is.
              </p>
              <p>
                The effectiveness of your disguise depends in part on how much you’re attempting to change your appearance.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their Spot checks. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for.
              </p>
              <p>
                Usually, an individual makes a Spot check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and each hour thereafter. If you casually meet many different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Spot modifier for the group.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can apply disguises to other.
              </p>
              <p>
                You need a disguise kit or appropriate materials (makeup, clothing, etc.) to make a disguise.

            <div>
              
              <p>
                Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged, enough light or sufficient visual acuity to see the details of what you’re writing, wax for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a government decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person’s handwriting is needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Forgery check is made secretly, so that you’re not sure how good your forgery is. As with Disguise, you don’t even need to make a check until someone examines the work. The DC for your forgery check is the wisdom score of the person examining it. Alternatively, if they are skilled in Forgery themselves (like an opposing spymaster), they can roll an opposed forgery check.
              </p>
              <p>
                A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous knowledge, or one that requires sacrifice on the part of the person checking the document can increase that character’s suspicion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similar to the result of successfully lying, the receiver might believe the document to be real, but choose to disregard its contents.

            <div>
              <h4 id="first-aid">First Aid</h4>
              <p>
                A character with at least 3 ranks in heal can recover some of a character’s hit points suffered from a combat or traumatic event (like falling off a ladder).
              </p>
              <p>
                To do so, such a character expends a usage of a healing kit and heals their heal bonus.
              </p>
              <p>
                The character recovers that many hit points. A character cannot heal more than the damage received during the combat or traumatic event.
              </p>
              <p>
                The above assumes the character is treated within 10 minutes of the event. The amount that may be recovered is halved if longer then this time period. It is halved again after 24 hours and is no longer possible after 48 hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only one attempt can be made on the aided character.

              <h4 id="long-term-care">Long Term Care</h4>
              <p>
                A character with at least 5 ranks in heal can effectively provide long term care to wounded persons.
                Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.

              <p>
                A trained healer can attempt to remove the poison from a poisoned person within 1 minute of the poisoning. Roll a heal check. If the check is higher than the initial poison DC, the poison is removed and any ability damage is undone. If the poison was a save-or-die poison, the victim is recussitated and loses 1d6 hit points instead of dying. If this check fails, a second check may be made against the secondary damage of the poison. This check replaces the victim's fortitude save if it is better.

              <p>
                Armor check penalty applies to jumping.
              </p>
              <p>
                The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below).
              </p>
              <p>
                Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a -6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.
              </p>
              <p>
                All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.
              </p>
              <p>
                Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="long-jump">Long Jump</h4>
              <p>
                Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.
              </p>
              <p>
                A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).
              </p>
              <p>
                If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don’t clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="high-jump">High Jump</h4>
              <p>
                A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high above or to grasp something overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared.
                Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the character or creature. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Quadrupedal creatures don’t have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat them as being one size category smaller.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="hop-up">Hop Up</h4>
              <p>
                You can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="jumping-down">Jumping Down</h4>
              <p>
                If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.

                A character with no ranks in ride can still ride a horse, but cannot effectively control a mount in combat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Special: A character can always take 5 on these skills.

              <h4 id="guide-with-knees">Guide with Knees (DC 5)</h4>
              <p>
                You can react instantly to guide your mount with your knees so that you can use both hands in combat. Make your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this round because you need to use the other to control your mount.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="stay-in-saddle">Stay in Saddle (DC 5)</h4>
              <p>
                You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take damage. This usage does not take an action.
              </p>

              <h4 id="fight-with-warhorse">Fight with Warhorse (DC 10)</h4>
              <p>
                If you direct your war-trained mount to attack in battle, you can still make your own attack or attacks normally. This usage is a free action.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="cover">Cover (DC 15)</h4>
              <p>
                You can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can’t attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check, you don’t get the cover benefit. This usage does not take an action.

              <p>
                You can react instantly to try to take no damage when you fall off a mount—when it is killed or when it falls, for example. If you fail your Ride check, you take 1d6 points of falling damage. This usage does not take an action.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="leap">Leap (DC 15)</h4>
              <p>
                You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. Use your Ride modifier or the mount’s Jump modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an action, but is part of the mount’s movement.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="spur-mount">Spur Mount (DC 15)</h4>
              <p>
                You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move action. A successful Ride check increases the mount’s speed by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You can use this ability every round, but each consecutive round of additional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount as the previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).

              <p>
                As a move action, you can attempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="fast-mount-or-dismount">Fast Mount or Dismount (DC 20)</h4>
              <p>
                You can attempt to mount or dismount from a mount of up to one size category larger than yourself as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. You can’t use fast mount or dismount on a mount more than one size category larger than yourself.

            <h3 id="scent">Scent (Wis, trained only, animal only)</h3>
            <div>
              
              <p>
                Scent is an unusual skill, as normally only animals and monsters can have it.
                Some unusual abilities allow players to purchase ranks in it however.
              </p>
              <p>
                Scent is used to smell things, both now and past.
              </p>
              <p>
                Creatures with the scent skill can identify familiar odors just as humans do
                familiar sights.
              </p>
              <p>
                Water, particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures.
                Water-breathing creatures that have the scent skill, however, can use it in
                the water easily.
              </p>
              <p>
                False, powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor
                completely spoils the ability to properly detect, identify or locate creatures.
                Some odors still afford some ability to detect scents, but increase the DC by 10.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="smell-position">Smell Position</h4>
              <p>
                A creature with the scent skill can attempt to locate the position of a creature by
                scent alone. The DC for such a task is usually 10, but it can be 5 for stinky creatures
                (like orcs) or even lower (like for trogs), or higher (like 15 for reptiles). The
                creature must be within 30 feet in relatively still conditions. If downwind, the
                range is 15' and upwind the range is 60'.
              </p>
              <p>
                A successful check indicates the direction of the creature (or creatures). If
                adjacent to the creature, their position is revealed.
              </p>

              <p>
                This works like the ranger's <a href="#track">track</a> ability, but the base DC is 10 for a fresh trail. For each hour the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2.

                Scent can be used as you can imagine it could in the real world. The DM will set an appropriate DC.

                In some circumstances you can move and remain hidden (like moving behind curtains). In such a circumstance, you can move up to one half your normal speed and remain hidden. Otherwise, moving means you are no longer hidden.

              <p>
                Swimming in armor of medium or heavier is impossible. If you are wearing medium or heavy armor you immediately start sinking and go underwater. The time to remove armor is doubled in the water.
              </p>
              <p>
                Swimming in light armor is possible, but suffers a -4 penalty immediately. This penalty doubles after 1 minute.
              </p>
              <p>
                Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to twice your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you begin to drown.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.

                    A character can only control/manage one of these. He can turn over the institution

                    Additionally, you can recruit a loyal cohort. The cohort is an NPC two levels lower

                    can pick one. You can request a broad category of character: Warrior, Rogue,
                    Priest, Mage.

                    After recruitment, the cohort earns experience at half the rate you do if he does
                    not accompany you on adventures. If he does accompany you on adventures, he gets a
                    half-share of the treasure and earns a proportionate amount of XP (which is

                  If you deal a creature enough damage with a melee attack to make it dead/unconscious, you get an immediate, extra melee attack against another creature within reach.

                    When you would deal sneak attack damage, you can forgo damage dice in favor of other effects. You cannot reduce your damage pool to 0 dice. All effects are a fort save to negate against a DC of 10+Dex Mod+(Level+1)/2. Once a target has been affected by an effect, they are immune to that effect for 24 hours. Ie if you blind an opponent, you can’t blind them again for 24 hours.

                Some sorcerer feats are marked as being a metamagic feat. A metamagic feat is a feat that modifies a spell. A feat modified by metamagic usually requires expending a slot of a higher level than normal for the spell. However, the spell is not higher level for the effects that care about the spell's level. Only one metamagic can be applied to a single casting of a spell.

                  When you take damage, add an equal amount of points to your Blood Pool. When you apply metamagic to a spell, you can spend 5 points from your Blood Pool to reduce the level adjustment by 1. You can use this ability only once per spell, even if applying more than one metamagic. A metamagic must have at least a +1 adjustment to qualify. Your Blood Pool is reset whenever you start a new encounter.

                  All spells you cast that deal damage have their damage type changed to the associated type.

For each level of spell you would have at least one slot for beyond 1st level, subtract one spell point. To cast a spell, you must spend spell points equal to the spell level.

                Some wizard feats are marked as being a metamagic feat. A metamagic feat is a feat that modifies a spell. A feat modified by metamagic usually requires it to be prepared in a slot of a higher level than normal for the spell. However, the spell is not higher level for the effects that care about the spell's level. Only one metamagic can be applied to a single casting of a spell.

              <p>
                Any attack at less than this distance is not penalized for range.
                However, each full range increment imposes a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll.
                A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments.
                A projectile weapon can shoot out to ten range increments.

                  Blunderbusses must be reloaded after firing, which provokes attacks of opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A blunderbuss is a firearm. On a roll of natural 1, the weapon is fouled and cannot be fired until unfouled (a process that takes 5 minutes).
                </p>
                <p>
                  When firing at a creature within 30', you can target an additional creature adjacent to your target with the same attack roll. Roll only once and apply to both.

                  A harpoon can be thrown. A harpoon that deals 8 or more damage impales into the victim. If a rope is attached to the harpoon (which gives it a -2 attack penalty due to the awkardness), the victim cannot move beyond the lead of the rope. If the rope is held short by you or others, they can make strength checks to move, which takes half their movement (or all of it on a failure).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The harpoon can be removed, but deals 8 damage on the way out if taken out violently (taking it out gently requires a DC 10 heal check). In the case of the rope, succeeding by 10 or more means the harpoon is violently ripped out. After 3 checks, the harpoon is not coming out.

                  Crossbows require crossbow bolts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a -4 penalty on attack rolls.

                  Crossbows require crossbow bolts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a -2 penalty on attack rolls.

                  You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size.
                  A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted.
                  A longbow requires at least 13 strength to use.
                  If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls.

                  A longspear has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe. If you use a ready action to set a longspear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.

                  A musket is a firearm. On a roll of natural 1, the weapon is fouled and cannot be fired until unfouled (a process that takes 5 minutes).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A bayonet can be mounted on the end of the musket. This weapon is a d10, 2-handed melee weapon with a 19-20/x2 crit. Switching your hold on your musket to melee is equivelant to drawing a weapon.

                <p>
                  Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack suffers -1 to the roll and -1 damage.

                  A whip deals nonlethal damage.
                  The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don’t threaten the area into which you can make an attack.
                  In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can make trip attacks with a whip.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus to disarm.

              <h4 id="armor-proficiency">Armor Proficiency</h4>
              <p>
                Characters can only wear armor they are proficient in.

            <div>
              <h4 id="armorshield-bonus">Armor/Shield Bonus</h4>
              <p>
                Each armor grants an armor bonus to AC, while shields grant a shield bonus to AC. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn’t stack with other effects or items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn’t stack with other effects that grant a shield bonus.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="maximum-dex-bonus">Maximum Dex Bonus</h4>
              <p>
                This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC that this type of armor allows. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer’s ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn’t affect any other Dexterity-related abilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even if a character’s Dexterity bonus to AC drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as losing a Dexterity bonus to AC.
              </p>

                <p>
                  Any armor heavier than leather hurts a character’s ability to use some skills. An armor's skill penalty is the penalty that applies to Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, and Tumble checks by a character wearing a certain kind of armor.
                </p>
              </div>

                <p>
                  If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both  penalties apply.

              <h4 id="drown">Drown</h4>
              <p>
                The drown column indicates whether a character can swim while wearing the armor. This assumes open sea. A value of "Yes" means the character immediately starts sinking and swimming is impossible. A value of "Maybe" indicates a -10 penalty to swim.
              </p>
              <p>
                See the drowning rules for how long you have once you start sinking.

                Wizards and sorcerers cannot cast spells while wearing any armor. The exception is elven fighter/wizards in elven chain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bards can only cast in light armor.

              <h4 id="speed">Speed</h4>
              <p>
                The speed column indicates a multipler on your base movement speed. Round up to the nearest 5' increment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Heavy armor reduces your run speed from x4 to x3.

                not initiated, or no grapple points are earned or you do not escape from the pin.

                You earn half as many grapple points as if you succeeded on a grapple contest.
              </p>

              <p>
                While engaged in the grapple, you can either try to earn grapple points, escape the
                grapple, or attack your opponent.
              </p>
              <p>
                Earning grapple points is an attack (so if you have multiple attacks due to high BAB or
                haste, you can do it more than once). To earn grapple points, win an opposed grapple
                check.
              </p>
              <p>
                To escape, win an opposed grapple check (or you can use escape artist), but your
                opponent gets +2 to their roll. If your opponent lets you escape, there is no need to
                roll.
              </p>
              <p>
                Attacking your opponent is at -4 and can only be done with light weapons, unarmed
                attacks, natural weapons or armor spikes.
                Monks and natural weapons do not suffer the -4.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, you can spend grapple points as a free action once per turn. If there is
                more than one enemy in the grapple, you can spend your grapple points as many times as
                there are enemies, once for each.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only spells you can cast while grappling are those with no somatic components and
                those fail 50% of the time.

                <p>
                  A pinned creature's only possible action is to try to escape from the pin, which they
                  can do by besting the enemy's grapple check. The enemy gets a +4 bonus. If they
                  succeed, they are no longer pinned (and are standing), but are still in the grapple.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pinned creatures still aid in multiple grappling (as keeping them pinned distracts
                  the pinner).

                <p>
                  A subdued creature is defeated and is no longer able to fight due to a combination of
                  exhaustion, bruising, etc. Treat them as having as much subdual damage as necessary
                  to bring them to -10. They are effectively no longer combatants.

                  If a grapple is already ongoing, you don't need to roll to join it. Additionally, if
                  a creature next to you is grappled, you are allowed to join the grapple as well
                  immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The area of a grapple is as many 5ft squares as there are participants, divided by
                  two. Adjust as needed for larger creatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each round, randomly pair off who you are rolling against. If there is an excess on
                  one side, the remainder pair up as they want, but this must be divided as evenly as
                  possible.

                <p>
                  When a subgroup rolls against a subgroup, the creature within a subgroup with the
                  highest bonus makes the check and the others grant him a +2 bonus per each of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Creatures within a subgroup may pool their grapple points to achieve results.

                <p>
                  For example, Krug the 8th level barbarian goes into a dungeon and encounters 4
                  2HD orcs who refuse to join his clan. To make them join, he enters into a grapple
                  with them. The 4 orcs are paired against Krug. The orc's individual grapple bonus is
                  +5 and Krug's is +20 while raging as he has gone hard on grapple. One of the orcs is
                  the chosen one to roll against krug each round and the others lend him +6 in total.
                  Thus, the orc will roll at +11 and Krug rolls at +20. Krug easily wins his check and
                  earns 1d4 + 8 grapple points, in this case 12 (rolled a 4 +8). As this is the
                  initiation of the grapple, he earns half as many points and thus 6. Krug has a second
                  attack, so he goes for it again, winning and earning another 9 points. He uses 12 of
                  his 15 points to immediately pin two of the orcs. On the orcs' turn they go for
                  points and roll at +11 again (+5 and 3 aiders is +11). They manage to best krug this
                  round and roll d4+2 = 5 grapple points. This goes on for a while until krug has
                  subdued all of the orcs and forces them into his clan.
